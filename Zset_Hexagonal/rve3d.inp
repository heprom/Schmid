   #NOTE1: The only values of interest for Zset are the one associated to the material declared. All the other values are discarded: e.g. we can always define a plane with normal (1,1,1) in space. But for a HCP crystal it does not correspond to any physical crystallographic plane and in addition it does not correspond to any dense plane --> This is useless to study the shear on this plane.
   #NOTE1: We reuse the code of FCC latice. But since we declared a material gen_evp with basal potential (meaning implicitly that we deal with a HCP crystal) we want to evaluate the corresponding physical resolved shear stresses. We do not deal with a FCC cubic lattice anymore (no octahedral oct potential declared) --> "tau_oct" values don't mean anything for Zset. It would return default value zero --> We comment those output values to not generate them uselessly
